    basic_nv_test.bat description:
    This batch file contains commands that run the basic_nv_test.js sample with different arguments.
      * The first command runs the sample without displaying debug messages in the console.
      * The second command, which is commented out, runs the sample and displays debug messages in the console.
      * The third command, which is commented out, displays the list of supported arguments for the basic_nv_test.js sample.

    basic_nv_test.js description:
    This sample demonstrates the use of the most basic NV methods.

    First, the sample creates a TestManager object and initializes it.
    The sample starts an NV test over an emulated "3G Busy" network.
    ("3G Busy" is one of NV's built-in network profiles. A network profile specifies the
    network traffic behavior, including latency, packet loss, and incoming/outgoing bandwidth.
    Network profiles are used to emulate traffic over real-world networks.)

    Next, the sample navigates to the home page in the HPE Network Virtualization website using the Selenium WebDriver.

    Finally, the sample stops the NV test.

    basic_nv_test.js steps:
    1. Create a TestManager object and initialize it.
    2. Start the NV test with the "3G Busy" network scenario.
    3. Build the Selenium WebDriver.
    4. Navigate to: http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/network-virtualization/index.html
    5. Close and quit the Selenium WebDriver.
    6. Stop the NV test.
