    basic_comparison_without_nv.bat description:
    This batch file contains commands that run the basic_comparison_without_nv.js sample with different arguments.
    * The first command runs the sample without displaying debug messages in the console.
    * The second command, which is commented out, runs the sample and displays debug messages in the console.
    * The third command, which is commented out, displays the list of supported arguments for the basic_comparison_without_nv.js sample.

    basic_comparison_without_nv.js description:
    This sample demonstrates how NV helps you test your application under various network conditions.

    This test starts by navigating to the home page in the HPE Network Virtualization website using the Selenium WebDriver.
    This initial step runs without NV emulation and provides a basis for comparison.

    Next, the sample starts an NV test configured with a "3G Busy" network scenario.
    The same step runs as before - navigating to the home page in the HPE Network Virtualization website - but this time,
    it does so over an emulated "3G Busy" network as part of an NV transaction.

    When the sample finishes running, it prints a summary to the console. This summary displays a comparison of the time
    it took to navigate to the site both with and without NV's network emulation. The results show that the slow "3G Busy"
    network increases the time it takes to navigate to the site, as you would expect.

    basic_comparison_without_nv.js steps:
    1. Build the Selenium WebDriver.
    2. Navigate to: http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/network-virtualization/index.html
    3. Close and quit the Selenium WebDriver.
    4. Create and initialize the TestManager object.
    5. Set the active adapter.
    6. Start the NV test with the "3G Busy" network scenario.
    7. Connect to the transaction manager.
    8. Start the "Home Page" NV transaction.
    9. Rebuild the Selenium WebDriver.
    10. Navigate to the site again.
    11. Stop the "Home Page" NV transaction.
    12. Close and quit the Selenium WebDriver.
    13. Stop the NV test.
    14. Analyze the NV test and extract the network time for the NV transaction.
    15. Print the network time comparison summary to the console.
