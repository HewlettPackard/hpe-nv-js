    adv_multiple_tests_sequential.bat description:
    This batch file contains commands that run the adv_multiple_tests_sequential.js sample with different arguments.
      * The first command runs the sample with the analysis result .zip file arguments and does not display debug messages in the console.
      * The second command, which is commented out, runs the sample and gets the analysis results as objects. It displays debug messages in the console.
      * The third command, which is commented out, displays the list of supported arguments for the adv_multiple_tests_sequential.js sample.

    adv_multiple_tests_sequential.js description:
    This sample shows how to run several tests sequentially with different network scenarios.

    adv_multiple_tests_sequential.js steps:
    1. Create and initialize the TestManager object.
    2. Set the active adapter.
    3. Start the first NV test with the "3G Busy" network scenario.
    4. Connect the first NV test to the transaction manager.
    5. Start the "Home Page" NV transaction in the first NV test.
    6. Build the Selenium WebDriver.
    7. Navigate to: http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/network-virtualization/index.html
    8. Stop the "Home Page" NV transaction in the first NV test.
    9. Close and quit the Selenium WebDriver.
    10. Stop the first NV test.
    11. Analyze the first NV test and get the result as an object or as a .zip file, if the --zip-result-file-path argument is specified.
    12. Print the NV transaction's network time or the location of the .zip file for the first test, if the --zip-result-file-path argument is specified.
    13. Start the second NV test with the "3G Good" network scenario.
    14. Connect the second NV test to the transaction manager.
    15. Run the same transaction in the second test (repeat steps 5-9).
    16. Stop the second NV test.
    17. Analyze the second NV test and get the result as an object or as a .zip file, if the --zip-result-file-path argument is specified.
    18. Print the NV transaction's network time or the location of the .zip file for the second test, if the --zip-result-file-path argument is specified.
