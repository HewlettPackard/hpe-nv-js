    adv_multiple_tests_concurrent.bat description:
    This batch file contains commands that run the adv_multiple_tests_concurrent.js sample with different arguments.
      * The first command runs the sample with the analysis result .zip file arguments and does not display debug messages in the console.
      * The second command, which is commented out, runs the sample and gets the analysis results as objects. It displays debug messages in the console.
      * The third command, which is commented out, runs the sample with the analysis result .zip file arguments and with ports configured for the first and second test flows.
      * The forth command, which is commented out, runs the sample and gets the analysis results as objects and with ports configured for the first and second test flows.
      * The fifth command, which is commented out, displays the list of supported arguments for the adv_multiple_tests_concurrent.js sample.

    adv_multiple_tests_concurrent.js description:
    This sample shows how to run several tests concurrently with different flow definitions.
    When running NV tests in parallel, make sure that:
    * each test is configured to use multi-user mode
    * the include/exclude IP ranges in the tests' flows do not overlap---this ensures data separation between the tests

    adv_multiple_tests_concurrent.js steps:
    1. Create and initialize the TestManager object.
    2. Set the active adapter.
    3. Start the first NV test with "Flow1" - view the sample's code to see the flow's properties.
    4. Connect the first NV test to the transaction manager.
    5. Start the second NV test with "Flow2" - view the sample's code to see the flow's properties.
    6. Connect the second NV test to the transaction manager.
    7. Start the "Home Page" NV transaction in the first test.
    8. Start the "Home Page" NV transaction in the second test.
    9. Build the Selenium WebDriver.
    10. Navigate to: http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/network-virtualization/index.html
    11. Stop the "Home Page" NV transaction in the first test.
    12. Stop the "Home Page" NV transaction in the second test.
    13. Stop the first NV test.
    14. Stop the second NV test.
    15. Analyze the first NV test and get the result as an object or as a .zip file, if the --zip-result-file-path argument is specified.
    16. Print the NV transaction's network time or the location of the .zip file for the first test, if the --zip-result-file-path argument is specified.
    17. Analyze the second NV test and get the result as an object or as a .zip file, if the --zip-result-file-path argument is specified.
    18. Print the NV transaction's network time or the location of the .zip file for the second test, if the --zip-result-file-path argument is specified.
    19. Close and quit the Selenium WebDriver.
